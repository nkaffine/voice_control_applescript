# voice_control_applescript

This appplescript uses applescripts built in voice recognition and spotifys applescript api to control spotify. This is designed to be run on a computer that is on and controlling the audio of a room. Some features were initially designed to have the applescript interupt conversations when key words were said but this feature did not work very well due to the placement of the computer.
